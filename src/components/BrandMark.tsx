 * The mark for CRediT Matrix: a 3x3 crop of the contribution matrix, lead on the diagonal.
 * Cells are drawn in `currentColor` at the app's three intensity tiers, and the
 * color is the workspace's own heatmap hue, so the mark is a live swatch of the
 * grid rather than a fixed sticker. The wordmark beside it stays on the primary
 * token: a hue is chosen for cell legibility, and some of the presets would not
 * carry text contrast.
 *
 * The store skips hydration, so server and first client render both use the
 * default ink-blue; the transition covers the swap to a stored hue.
 *
 * The favicon (`src/app/icon.svg`) carries the same geometry with literal fills.
