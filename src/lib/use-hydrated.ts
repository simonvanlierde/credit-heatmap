 * False until the persisted draft has been restored, true from then on.

 * The store uses `skipHydration` and rehydrates from a mount effect (see
 * contribution-store.ts), so there is a brief window where the interface is
 * live but still showing the empty initial state. Anything typed in that window
 * is overwritten the moment the restored draft lands — the text is simply gone,
 * with nothing to say it ever arrived.
 *
 * Gate text inputs on this: Playwright and real people alike wait out a
 * read-only field, where both would lose a discarded keystroke.
