 * False through the first painted frame of a restored draft, true from the next
 * frame on. Gate an entrance class on this and a page load stays still while a
 * later arrival (an import, the sample data, a share link) animates: adding a
 * class to an element that is already on screen changes no property and re-runs
 * no `@starting-style`, so nothing plays retroactively.
 *
 * It waits on rehydration (via useHydrated) rather than on mount alone. The
 * store uses skipHydration (see contribution-store.ts), so contributors
 * restored from localStorage land in a render *after* the first one, so a
 * plain frame counter would race them and animate the whole draft on every
 * reload.
